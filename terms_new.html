and any
associated refunds on the website of the third party re-seller from

number of
Coins or the total monetary value of Coins that you may purchase at one
time,
or over a given period of time, in our sole discretion. Newly purchased
Coins
credits may not be available for immediate use. If you make any
unauthorized
purchases of Coins, or if any of your purchase of Coins leads to
charge-reversals, chargebacks, disputed charges, dispute fees, or any
allegation of payment fraud, we may terminate your account, with or
without
notice, in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">All
purchases of Coins are FINAL and non-refundable, except

any
reason, you will lose and forfeit any outstanding Coins The virtual

license
right granted by us and you do not acquire any ownership right to any
such
virtual items. We may terminate such license right and withdraw or
discontinue
any virtual item in the Site environment or may remove your right to
use any
particular virtual item or service. Any exchanges of coins for virtual
items
are non-reversible.</p>
